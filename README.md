## Description
This repo is for "Sports Course" Project which is a computer simulation project covering part of the sports relevant concepts.
## Tasks
### Task 1
Designing a simulation program for tennis ball ace shot as it's found to obey a cumulative [Gaussian probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) of the ball hit speed with a **mean of 160 km/h** and a **standard deviation of 20 km/h**. Using a graphical user interface, **Make use of the ball hit speed as a control knob and the corresponding probability as an indicator.**

### Task 2
Design a simulation program with a graphical user interface for **Projectile Simulation** `(e.g. Soccer Game)`. Considering a foul kick scenario, Display the following parameters:

**Control Knobs :**
- Distance from the goal
- Firing velocity
- Firing angle

**Indicators :**
- Maximum ball height
- Ball height at the goal plane arrival point
